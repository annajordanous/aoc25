We just installed a new server rack, but we aren't having any luck getting the reactor to communicate with it!\" You glance around the room and see a tangle of cables and devices running from the server rack to the reactor. She rushes off, returning a moment later with a list of the devices and their outputs (your puzzle input).\n",
